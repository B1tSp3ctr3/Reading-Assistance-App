The Frontman hates the widespread misconception, such that the quadtree can perform range queries in O(log 1) time when there are n
leaf nodes inside the region. In fact, sometimes it is necessary to query much more than O(log 1) regions for this, and the time
complexity is O(n) in some extreme cases. Thus, the Frontman came up with this task to educate you about this worst case of the data
structure.
